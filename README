Full description:

This is my first reasonably-sized project in Racket. Having used it to do the exercises in SICP I really wanted to play around and learn more of the language. So I decided try and write a desktop application for myself and friends to remedy a common irritation: badly-named files.

The app uses regular expressions to standardize and 'clean' file names. The rules for renaming are exposed in an XML file (.NameCleanRules.xml) with a simple syntax, e.g.:

<allow>this phrase</allow>
<delete>this particular phrase</delete>

This should allow a sophisticated user to add their own rules on the fly. There is also a CLI version of the app to suit script-writers.

As I mentioned above, this is my first reasonably sized project with Racket. Comments and criticisms are very welcome.

Rough guide to the files in this repo:

- rules.rkt : read the rules from the .xml and apply to a filename
- handle.rkt : deal with the user's input (e.g. reject hidden files, walk subfolders)
- cli.rkt : CLI version of the app
- lang.rkt : read translation files and make available appropriate labels for the GUI
- plist.rkt : read and write .plist files (used for preferences, translations)
- helper-functions.rkt : misc helper functions

- gui.rkt : just inits main loop for the GUI
- gui-main.rkt : all the main window components are here
- gui-prefs.rkt : all the preferences window components are here

- lang-en.plist : English translations
- lang-zh.plist : 简体中文 translations (half-finished)

- Preferences.plist : persists user preferences
[- MasterRules.xml : the master list of rules for renaming] DELETED: just editing the Racket code (see commands.rkt) directly is easier. Editing local copies still works for the user, but the master copy is effectively locked.

- tests.rkt : unified unit testing file
- *-test.rkt : individual unit tests
- test_folder/* : dummy files for testing
